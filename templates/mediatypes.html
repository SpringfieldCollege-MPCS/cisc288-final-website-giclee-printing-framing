                        <p class="">The choice of media for prints is often dictated by the original art work. Oil or acrylic on canvas is often reproduced on canvas to emulate the original as closely as possible. But sometimes an artist will want to offer alternatives to art purchasers and will have prints made on archival papers as well. Watercolor artists usually will choose a watercolor paper with texture similar to the media they used. Photographers often choose a luster photo paper or a smooth matte paper.</p>
