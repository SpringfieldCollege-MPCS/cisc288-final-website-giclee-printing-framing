    <p class="font-bodytext">
      Nancy Bryant, herself an artist and photographer,  explored different art techniques until settling on digital imaging as a medium. This led to the exploration of new technologies and the discovery of the Giclée process.  This process of imaging is done with archival pigment based inks on acid free media using state-of-the-art technology.
      <br><br><br>Inspired to move forward with this blend of technology and art, in 2003 she opened Giclée of New England, Inc. The services offered range from image capture to large format digital output. The frame shop offers custom framing. The gallery offers original art and limited edition prints featuring talented local artists and artisans. Over the years, Nancy developed quite a reputation for her expertise in art, photography, imaging services, digital editing and photo restoration.
